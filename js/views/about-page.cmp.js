 <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/izuku_midoriya_s4.png" alt="">
 <p>Even though <span>Izuku</span>  was born Quirkless, he manages to catch the attention of the legendary hero <span>All Might</span> , 
    due to his innate heroism and a strong sense of justice, and has since become his close pupil, 
    as well as a student in Class 1-A at U.A. High School. <span>All Might</span>  passed on his transferable Quirk to <span>Izuku</span> , 
    making him the ninth holder of One For All.
Following the Paranormal Liberation War, with Tomura Shigaraki and All For One actively targeting <span>Izuku</span>  for his Quirk, 
he decides to leave U.A. before finishing his first year to keep his classmates out of harm's way.[4] After encouragement from his friends, 
he later returns to the school and leads the heroes against the villains in one final, desperate battle to save the world.</p>
